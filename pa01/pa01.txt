Problem Statement
1. Design an algorithm to convert the change given in quarters, dimes, nickels,
   and pennies into pennies
2. Design an algorithm to convert the change given in pennies into quarters, 
   dimes, nickels, and pennies
3. Design an algorithm that takes two input values, hours and rate. It then 
   calculates pay_gross, which is your pay before deductions. The algorithm 
   then calculates the following three deduction amounts: 
   Federal tax (tax_fed, 20% of pay_gross); 
   State tax (tax_state, 5% of pay_gross); 
   and Social Security tax (tax_ss, 6.2% of pay_gross). 
   Your net pay, pay_net, is then computed, which is pay_gross minus the three 
   deductions.
4. Laurel and Hardy opened a new landscape maintenance service. They provide 
   three services:
     a. mowing ($35 per 5000 square yards)
     b. fertilizing ($30 per application)
     c. planting trees ($50 per tree)
   Design an algorithm that prompts the user to enter the length and width of 
   the lawn (in feet), the number of fertilizing applications, and the number 
   of trees to be planted. The algorithm then determines the billing amount. 
   All three services are ordered.
5. Design an algorithm that determines the smallest, middle, and largest values 
   of three unduplicated input values.

Input
1. quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies
2. pennies
3. hours, rate
4. length, width, num_fertilizer, num_trees
5. num1, num2, num3

Process
1.
  a. Multiply quarters by 25 
  b. Add quarters to total
  c. Multiply dimes by 10
  d. Add dimes to total
  e. Multiply nickels by 5
  f. Add dimes to total
  g. Add pennies to total
2.
  a. Divide total by 25 and add to quarters
  b. Subtract quarter amount in pennies from total
  c. Divide total by 10 and add to dimes
  d. Subtract dime amount in pennies from total
  e. Divide total by 5 and add to nickels
  f. Subtract nickel amount from total
3.
  a. Multiply hours by rate and add to pay_gross
  b. Multiply pay_gross by 0.20 and add to tax_fed
  c. Multiply pay_gross by 0.05 and add to tax_state
  d. Multiply pay_gross by 0.062 and add to tax_ss 
  e. Subtract tax_fed, tax_state, and tax_ss from pay_gross and add to pay_net
4.
  a. Divide length by 3
  b. Divide width by 3
  c. Calculate area of lawn and divide by 5000 (length * width) / 5000
  d. Multiply area by 35 and add to billing_amount
  e. Multiply num_fertilizer by 30 and add to billing_amount
  f. Multiply trees by 50 and add to billing_amount
5.
  a. If num1 > num2 and num1 > num3, then num1 is largest
    i. If num2 > num3, then num2 is middle and num3 is smallest
    ii. Else num3 is middle and num2 is smallest
  b. Else if num2 > num1 and num2 > num3, then num2 is largest
    i. If num1 > than num3, then num1 is middle and num3 is smallest
    ii. Else num3 is middle and num1 is smallest
  c. Else num3 is largest
    i. If num1 > num2, then num1 is middle and num2 is smallest
    ii. Else num2 is middle and num1 is smallest

Output
1. Print total in pennies to output device
2. Print quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies to output device
3. Print pay_gross, tax_fed, tax_state, tax_ss, and pay_net to output device
4. Print billing_amount to output device
5. Print smallest, middle, and largest
